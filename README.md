# etch-a-sketch

something between a sketchpad and etch-a-sketch

-BOILERPLATE
   // create html,css,js docs

   // create a container Div

   // in the middle of the page

-BOXES WITHIN THE CONTAINER
   // create 16*16 divs in it with js

   //use hover effect to change the color of the boxes as cursor hovers over it

-BUTTON
   //create a button

   //button will initiate a prompt

   //the input will return a number between 4 and 100

-GRID 
   //create a grid of a number user has entered

   //   userInput * userInput = totalNumber

   //  L/W of the box will dynamically change

   //   totalNumber / 265 = L & W of the boxes

-STYLE THE shit out of it
   // randomize colour of boxes

    thicker the border of container 
   // increase the size
    give it a title
    display the size beneath the container
